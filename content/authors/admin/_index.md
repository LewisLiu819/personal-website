    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Peizhuo Liu, a high school student from Middle School attached to Northwestern Polytechnical University. I'm interested in explainable AI, deep learning, and APEX legends(Well... Used to be). 

I'm currently developing a system for emotion classification, combined with explainable AI, to ensure its interpretability. I'm also leading and teaching a computer science course for elementary school kids, called COMPSCI 0.10.
